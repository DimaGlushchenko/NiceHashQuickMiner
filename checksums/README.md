# SHA1 & SHA256 Checksums for RELEASE files

After downloading a file, make sure the downloaded file has matching SHA1 & SHA256 hash. If you don't know how to do that, 
download and install [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html). In File Explorer, right click downloaded file, then select `CRC SHA` then `*`.

![How to check SHA hash](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashQuickMiner/blob/main/checksums/howtohash.png?raw=true)

If the file's SHA1 or SHA256 does not match **precisely with each letter and number** then under any condition **DO NOT USE THE FILE!** Mismatching checksums means that someone has tampered with the file hence the file is not from NiceHash but someone else and you cannot trust this file.
